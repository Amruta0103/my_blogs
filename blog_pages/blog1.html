      Now that I have developed the habit of coding daily, I would like to start writing blogs, in order to improve blog writing skills as well as for the #151daysofcode challenge.
      <br>During this week, I learnt:-
      <ul>
        <li>CSS positions,</li>
        <li>practiced flex properties,</li>
        <li>practiced few javascript problems, &</li>
        <li>practiced JSX.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>Earlier too, I have worked on HTML, CSS and little of JavaScript. But as I started learning again I learnt it was very vast than I had previously thought. But slowly gaining the pace it is easier now. The only thing to remember while learning anything new is to understand things in small parts then assemble them together to make it a wholesome idea, just like we create different components of a project and add them all to make the final thing.
      <br>The smaller the pieces of a concept, easier and better it gets to understand without the need of mugging up anything and when you need to use these concepts they easily come up to you.
      <br>Practicing the concepts, after understanding them, on your own makes it even better and fixed in your head without extra efforts.
      <br>While learning it’s a good habit to make a note of the jargons you come across, it helps throughout the learning process. 
      <br>JARGONS are the terms for various things used professionally.  
      <br>Also taking notes of your own are a good way to memorize things better.
      <br>Last but not the least, even if you know all these techniques it’s very important to practice regularly what you have learnt.
      <br><br>Happy Learning!!
